scale in architecture 
Architecture has been a way of representing and documenting the building or design to be built.Scale in Architecture focuses on incorporating some sort of structure or idea to add rustication and to have some sort of unpredictable gestures.The idea of rustication is not only about how a surface is smooth or rough, looking into the meaning of rustication, Rustication can include a process to create form. a form that canâ€™t be entirely in control. Rustication can property be applied with random ideas like scale, rotation, gestures, carves, turns, chip, and voids.This is what the project will take, the idea of rustication, which will include how statice the finished project will be. With use of scripting, multiple cubes will form a structure that will allow users to control how static or rustic the project will be. The use of scale rotation and repetition will depict the outcome of the project. What if unit, curve, rectangle, scale, and form clash to create the structure and apply the idea of rustication.
